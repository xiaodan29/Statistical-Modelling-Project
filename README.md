# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
- Explore the different API (Citybike, Foursquare, Yelp) with their structure, try to understand their functions and services, then convert them into different Pandas dataframe
- Join different dataframes into a new dataframe and do the EDA process with visualization
- Collect and create my own database with SQLite and try to validate my date
- Builda regression model with those data I collected, try to do the analysis and interpret those results

## Process
### Step 1 Explore APIs with Citybike, Foursquare and Yelp
### Step 2 Parse JSON object into Pandas dataframe
### Step 3 Merge dataframe to a comperhensive one and clean the data
### Step 4 Explore dataframe with EDA and do the data visualization
### Step 5 Create SQLite database use the date I've collected
### Step 6 Builda regression model with those data and analysis the results

## Results
- Yelp is the most detailed API which can provide variable functions and services for developers,but Foursquare is very simple to use while Citybike is need to be get more advanced details for filtering. 
- Overall, the model suggests that the rating of the POIs can be a better predictor of the number of bikes compared to the number of restaurants in a location. However, it is important to note that the R-squared value of the model is low, indicating that there might be other factors that influence the number of bikes in a location.

## Challenges 
- Explore and retrieve information from different APIs is the big challenge for me. It is a kind of hard to find the correct path and parameters at the very beginning. 
- Join the data and try to find the correct number and columns is another challenge for me. Understand the fundation of JSON is very important part to go process the following steps. 

## Future Goals
- Probably will get more familiar with how to get more effective data from different APIs and filter with JSON.
- With the visualization , I need more practise to get fully understand how to use every single chart and plot.
